## Aspartam vs Actix

TODO
## Why Aspartam

While `actix` is great, it makes using `async`/`await` problematic in message handlers. Workarounds exist but that continues to be a major pain-point. 

I decided to create something that feels similar to `actix` but requires a lot less hassle and has less complexity overall.


# TODO

* Documentation
* Maybe something like `actix`'s `Recipient`
* Publish on crates.io
